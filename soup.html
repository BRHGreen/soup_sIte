	 Yesterday I had soup for lunch. Today I also had soup for lunch. The soup I had today was no ordinary soup however. I thought that today I would try some lentil soup from one of the many Turkish restaurants close to my place of work. It was good. The Turkish places around here generally give you a lot of food for your money and this was no exception. The soup itself was also very delicious. I made a good choice.
